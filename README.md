# Project aims:

This project aims to produce data insights that help UNICEF to highlight the 
challenges the world’s children are having. UNICEF asks to
1. Visualize what life looks like for children under 5 years old in the world today. What is/are the biggest direct or indirect challenge(s) the children face today? 
2. Choose and focus on the top challenge(s) and highlight the issues affecting it. Make a 
country-level analysis of the challenge(s). Are these focused on certain areas of the world, speciﬁc a group of countries or are these a global phenomena?
